#C-db

This is a simple beginner friendly key-value pair database written in ansi C.
Note: There is no secure entry and the database uses text based files with extension .cdb

In v0.0 only this data-types are supported:

-- STRING
-- INT
-- FLOAT
-- NONE

This database should not be used in case of storage of sensitive information because as of now (0.0) there is no authentication feature.

(NOTE: this project contains experimental or sometimes incomplete code fully implemented database could be found on my other account Darshan-Paradox)
